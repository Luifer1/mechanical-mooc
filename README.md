# Mechanical MOOC [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/p2pu/mechanical-mooc.png)](https://travis-ci.org/p2pu/mechanical-mooc)

The Mechanical MOOC is a web based app for running a course with a large number of users. Users can sign up for a course, you can send regular email updates about the course and group people into small groups where they can discuss the course with their peers. Nothing more and nothing less.

## Documentation

Instructions for setting up the Mechanical MOOC is on [mechanical-mooc.readthedocs.org](http://mechanical-mooc.readthedocs.org/en/latest/).

You can also head over to the [P2PU forum](http://thepeople.p2pu.org/t/using-the-mechanical-mooc-for-large-online-courses/437) and tell us about your course and ask questions!
