          <h1>How It works.</h1>
          <h2>The PWYM Community</h2>
          <p>When you join the <a href="http://community.playwithyourmusic.org">PWYM Community</a>, you'll have access to courses and creative music making modules that focus on critical listening, recording analysis, audio FX, mixing, and remixing. You'll also be able to join groups of creative and curious musicians just like you, with whom you'll learn and collaborate on course projects.</p>
         
          <h2>Music making and learning experiences.</h2>
          <p>For each module in a course, you'll receive a series of readings and an activity prompting you to play with music on the web. You'll work through the materials over the course of the week, and share your projects with the PWYM community.</p>
         
          <h2>Support if you're lost, stuck or curious.</h2>
          <p>Play With Your Music also has an embedded <a href="http://community.playwithyourmusic.org">community</a> of like minded musicians and learners for you to ask questions, find additional resources, or connect with other folks outside your areas of musical interest and expertise.</p>

        <h1>The Music You'll Work With.</h1>
        <h2>Peter Gabriel</h2>
        <p>For this version of PWYM (2.0!), we've partnered with dual Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductee and legend Peter Gabriel. Peter has graciously collaborated with us providing access to multitrack recordings of his hit songs <em>Sledgehammer</em> and <em>In Your Eyes</em> from the album <b>So</b>. You'll learn from video interviews with Peter and with the musicians who've performed and collaborated with him over the years.</p>
        <p>In PWYM 1.0, we partnered with singer/songwriter <a href="http://claraberry.com/">Clara Berry</a> and her producer/engineer <a href="http://bradfordswanson.com/?">Bradford Swanson</a> to give you an inside look at their recording production process. In addition to the amazing recordings of Peter Gabriel, you can work directly with her multitracks, samples, and loops in our custom <a href="http://www.nyu.edu/projects/ruthmann/PWYM/airtraffic">#PWYM Mix tool</a> and in <a href="http://soundation.com/air_traffic">Soundation.com</a>.</p>

        <h1>The Tools You'll Master.</h1>
        
        <p>You'll become familiar with a number of critical listening, recording and mixing tools over six weeks. All of these tools are free to use when you sign up for the PWYM community. A sneak preview of what's to come:</p>
        <h2><a href="http://www.nyu.edu/projects/ruthmann/PWYM/airtraffic">#PWYM Mix</a></h2>
        <p>In the first phase of the course, you'll become familiar with the basic "critical listening" skills of music--identifying instruments, voices and song structures. And you'll do it by playing with interactive multitrack recordings.</p>

        <h2><a href="http://soundation.com/">Soundation</a></h2>
        <p>Next you'll get your hands dirty by working with a Digital Audio Workstation (DAW) and learn the basics of audio track editing and shifting. Using Soundation you'll mix your own audio track to match a studio recording.</p>

        <h2><a href="https://soundcloud.com/">SoundCloud</a></h2>
        <p>Soon, you'll be remixing your favorite songs and coming up with your own glorious creations. You'll post the files to SoundCloud's listening community, share them with your cohort, and give each other feedback.</p>
