<p>Dear DLMOOC participants,</p>

<p>What a great first week of DLMOOC we&rsquo;re having! <a href="https://plus.google.com/u/1/communities/109999014963590178695/stream/de2cbb11-c507-4ecd-aa99-337f8b7d9caf">Groups are forming</a>; <a href="https://plus.google.com/u/1/communities/109999014963590178695">conversations are happening</a>; the community is super engaged!</p>

<p>Community members have been doing things like setting up a <a href="https://www.zeemaps.com/map?group=807434">participant map that we can all add ourselves to</a>, setting up <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/13093">Vialogues to discuss videos</a>, and adding their blogs to our new <a href="http://dlmooc.deeper-learning.org/blog-hub/">blog hub</a>. We love it, and hope you will feel free to come up with more exciting ways to make DLMOOC even better.</p>

<p>You can <a href="http://dlmooc.deeper-learning.org/weekly-materials/">visit this page </a>for a detailed list of all the readings, videos and other activities for this week. Don&rsquo;t forget our <a href="http://dlmooc.deeper-learning.org/live/">panel discussion at 4pm Pacific today</a>. (This will also be archived at <a href="http://www.dlmooc.net/live">www.dlmooc.net/live</a>.)</p>

<p>As we&rsquo;re getting started, we want to make a big class photo for this course. Follow <a href="http://{{ mooc_domain }}{% url classphoto_classphoto sequence=sequence %}?key=%recipient.key%">this link</a> to add your photo and see others in the course.</p>

<p>You might also want to consider doing one or more of the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Tweet of the Week </strong>- Think of a time during your youth when you had a significant learning experience. What was it + why was it so significant?<br />
      Tweet your response with the hashtags #WhatisDL #dlmooc</p>
        </li>
          <li>
            <p><strong><a href="http://dlmooc.deeper-learning.org/wk-1-put-it-to-practice-1-what-is-deeper-learning/">Put it Into Practice </a></strong>- These are activity ideas you can do individually or as part of a group.</p>
              </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Comment on others&rsquo; posts on the G+ community, Twitter, or on blogs.</p>
                    </li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>And if all this is new and mysterious to you and you&rsquo;re lurking around to see what&rsquo;s going on, that&rsquo;s great! <strong>We want you to participate in whatever way works for you.</strong></p>

                    <p>See you next week when we&rsquo;ll be looking at student work for deeper learning.</p>

                    <p>Sincerely,</p>

                    <p>Ben, Rob, Laura, Ryan, Karen, and the whole DLMOOC team</p>
