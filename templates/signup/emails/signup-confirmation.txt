Greetings Deeper Learners, 

Welcome to the Deeper Learning MOOC, a survey course brought to you by High Tech High, Peer 2 Peer University, MIT Media Lab with support by Hewlett Foundation and Raikes Foundation. 

The course brings together the big theoretical ideas in deeper learning with very practical hands-on application in the classroom (and out of the classroom).
