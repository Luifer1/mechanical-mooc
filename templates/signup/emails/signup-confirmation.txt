Welcome to "Play With Your Music"--we'll get underway in earnest on May 16th! 

First, two things you should know:

Browser requirements. We recommend you use Google Chrome for Play With Your Music--it's compatible with all of the tools we are using. You can download it here: https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/

The tools you'll need. In the meantime, you might want to register for an account with Soundation (http://soundation.com/) and SoundCloud (https://soundcloud.com/). We recommend signing up and installing any plugins you might need, like Adobe AIR.

Please visit and sign in to our new PWYM Community - http://community.playwithyourmusic.org. Introduce yourself, place your location on our collaborative Map, and get to know current and past PWYM participants. If you have any questions, post them there.

Now you've hit the Big Time...
